# Coursera - Programming with Google Go Specialization

This repository holds my solutions to the programming assignments for the three courses in the Coursera ["Programming with Google Go Specialization"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang) by [Ian Harris](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang#instructors). 

The three courses in this specialisation are:

- [Getting Started in Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started/home/welcome)
- [Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-functions-methods/home/welcome)
- [Concurrency in Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-concurrency/home/welcome)
